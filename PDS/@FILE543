//*   Short Description:                                            *   FILE 543
//*                                                                 *   FILE 543
//*      I have written some REXX code to display System            *   FILE 543
//*      Information.                                               *   FILE 543
//*                                                                 *   FILE 543
//*      I wrote it initially to verify a system after an IPL,      *   FILE 543
//*      and it grew from there.                                    *   FILE 543
//*                                                                 *   FILE 543
//*      The utility is called 'CHECKSYS'.                          *   FILE 543
//*                                                                 *   FILE 543
//*      It now uses pop-up ISPF panels, an assembler program       *   FILE 543
//*      ('cause I could not do it in REXX) and REXX.               *   FILE 543
//*                                                                 *   FILE 543
//*      I also continued to develop it as a means of               *   FILE 543
//*      understanding how OS/390 holds together and to utilize     *   FILE 543
//*      some of the 'fancier' statements of REXX.                  *   FILE 543
//*                                                                 *   FILE 543
//*      'CHECKSYS' has been verified on OS/390 2.6 and OS/390      *   FILE 543
//*      2.8.  Because I am contracting here in France, some of     *   FILE 543
//*      the characters used to define screen attributes, and       *   FILE 543
//*      used by REXX (! instead of |), may not operate             *   FILE 543
//*      correctly when used elsewhere.                             *   FILE 543
//*                                                                 *   FILE 543
//*      There is one part of this package written in Assembler.    *   FILE 543
//*      It is the member called GETUADDR, to return a UCB          *   FILE 543
//*      address, given a volume name.                              *   FILE 543
//*                                                                 *   FILE 543

//*      I have broken CHECKSYS up into it's individual             *   FILE 543
//*      compmnents.                                                *   FILE 543

//*      This way, you can call the component directly, or you      *   FILE 543
//*      can still use CHECKSYS.                                    *   FILE 543

//*      For example:                                               *   FILE 543

//*      You can call 'TSO LPA' directly, or still use the          *   FILE 543
//*      original CHECKSYS,                                         *   FILE 543

I have broken CHECKSYS up into it's individual compmnent.

This way, you can call the component direct, or you call still use CHECKSYS.

The components are:

APF - list out the current APF.
ASL - simple Address Space monitoring utility.
LNK - list out the current Linklist.
LPA - list out the current LPA list
MAP - display Storage Map.
STR - Display the Storage Usage.
SYS - display the System paramaters.
VER - display the Software Versions.

For example:

You can call 'TSO LPA' directly, or still use the original CHECKSYS,
'TSO CHECKSYS LPA' or 'TSO CHECKSYS 5' or just 'TSO CHECKSYS' and select
option 5.

I have written some REXX code to display System Information.

I wrote it initialy to verify a system after an IPL, and it grew
from there.

The utility is called 'CHECKSYS'.

It now uses pop-up ISPF panels, an assembler program ('cause I
could not do it in REXX) and REXX.

I also continued to develop it as a means of understanding how
OS/390 holds together and to utilize some of the 'fancier'
statements of REXX.

'CHECKSYS' has been verified on OS/390 2.6 and OS/390 2.8.
Because I am contracting here in France, some of the characters
used to define screen attributes, and used by REXX (! instead of
|), may not operate correctly when used elsewhere.

I know there are far superior programs (Showmvs, Tasid, etc.),
but I enjoyed writing mine and is useful to me in my work.  It is
probably full of 'features', because 'programmers can never see
the woods for the trees...'.

If you feel it would make a useful contribution to the CBT tape,
please feel free to use it.  David H. Barnard-Brown

Checksys was written to extend my use of REXX, and to provide a
simple tool to display System Information after an IPL.  It sort
of grew from there.

It is written in REXX, with panels that need to be copied into an
appropriate panel library and a simple Assembler program that
needs to be compiled on to an appripriate ISPLLIB library. The
assembler program uses the UCBSCAN macro.  If someone could show
me how to do this in REXX, I would be greatly appreciate it.

Since I am working in France, the keyboard characters will not
match US/UK keyboards.  For example, (| instead of ]), and some
attribute characters within the panels.  You will have to change
them to suitable local values.

The interface is fairly simple, where you enter either a number
or a character to select the option required.

The 'F'ind option requires that you enter 'F xxxx' where XXXX is
the character you are searching for.  The 'F'ind is available on
option 5 - 8.

Error handling is rudamentary to non-existant.  I have tried by
writing 'fast' code, not 'fancy' code.  Any errors I will gladly
attempt to fix, except when they are 'design features'.

Please feel free to update, replace or trash my code as much as
you like, just as long as you send me a copy.

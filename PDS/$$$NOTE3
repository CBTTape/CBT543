I have included two REXX routines that I regularly use prior to an IPL.

The first, CHKIPLPK, checks each IPL pack to ensure that all the NONVSAM
datasets are indirectly cataloged, either to &SYSR1 or &SYSR2.  It also
check that the datasets on &SYSR1 are correctly cataloged to &SYSR2 and
visa-versa.

The second, CHLMCAT, checks all the NONVSAM datasets in the
Master Catalog to verify that the dataset phyically exists|

These two utilities help me ensure the integrity of the system.
